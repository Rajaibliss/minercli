# Volara Miner

Miner for the Volara X DLP

# About

Volara is a decentralized data marketplace for X data, built on the robust Vana network. We empower users by giving them ownership of their data and enabling them to earn from it.

The Volara Miner is a software package which allows users to contribute X data to the network for rewards.

# Credentials

Volara uses two credentials to perform mining on Vana:

1. X username and password, for access to the Twitter API
2. Google OAUTH, for storing your mined X data in Google Drive.

# Install
